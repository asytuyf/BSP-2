My 2nd project for 2 semester at the university of Luxembourg.

# Description

A chess variant game called duck chess that is played against an AI player. The AI player can use minimax or alpha-beta pruning to decide which move to make, the two algorithms enable the AI to chose the best moves for his turn.

The duck chess variant adds a rubber duck that both players can move. The duck blocks the square itâ€™s on, making it impossible for pieces to move to that square or through it. This introduces new tactics and strategies to the game
