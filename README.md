A terminal line chess game as my 2nd project for my 2nd semester at the university of Luxembourg.

# Description

A chess variant game called duck chess that is played against an AI player. The AI player uses minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms (ùõº‚àíùõΩ) to decide the best move to make.

The duck chess variant adds a rubber duck that both players can move. The duck blocks the square it‚Äôs on, making it impossible for pieces to move to that square or through it. This introduces new tactics and strategies to the game
